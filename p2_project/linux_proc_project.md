# Linux PROC 

The linux file-system stores information about the processes of the OS in `/proc/`
and in `/etc/`

For example:  
- We can access information about the OS by using `cat /etc/os-release`
- We can check the meminfo by running `cat /proc/meminfo`
- We can check uptime by running `cat /proc/uptime`
- We can check processes by running `cat /proc/stat`
- We can check the kernel version by running `cat /etc/kernel`
